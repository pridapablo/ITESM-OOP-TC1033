# ITESM-OOP-TC1033

## Course Information
**Institution:** Tecnológico de Monterrey  
**Course:** TC1033 - Object Oriented Computational Thinking  
**Website:** [TC1033 Course Overview](https://samp.itesm.mx/Materias/VistaPreliminarMateria?clave=TC1033)

The ITESM-OOP-TC1033 repository contains the collection of programming assignments, exercises, and project examples that I worked on during the TC1033 course. It primarily includes solutions and concepts related to object-oriented programming as applied in computational thinking for engineering.

## Course Description
The course TC1033 at Tecnológico de Monterrey is designed to provide students with a foundational understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and their application in computational problem-solving within engineering contexts.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will have the ability to:

- Analyze and demonstrate the functioning of computational processes and information technologies.
- Evaluate problem components in accordance with computational principles and processes.
- Make decisions in problem-solving under conditions of uncertainty and varying complexity.
- Implement scientific and engineering actions or computational processes as required for solutions.
- Apply standards and norms in professional practice for solving computational and information technology problems.

## Repository Contents
This repository includes:

- Examples of structured programming in compiled languages.
- Solutions illustrating the use of OOP concepts like classes, objects, methods, and attributes.
- Implementations demonstrating the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, and message passing.
- Applications of class diagrams and understanding of relationships like inheritance and composition.
- Version control systems usage and examples.
